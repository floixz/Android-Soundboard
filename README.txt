This a soundboard I put together to start learning android programming.
It only currently has two sound clips, though I plan to either add more
sound clips in the future, or maybe add something else to the app.

Things I could possibly add:
  Playing a .gif when the button is pressed.
  A different icon for the application in the android launcher
  Change the color and/or background image of the app
